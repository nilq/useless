How to split a string in Rust?

How do I split a string in Rust? From its documentation it's not clear http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/trait.StrSlice.html In Java I'd do that by:

"some string 123 ffd".split("123");

Use split()

let mut split = "some string 123 ffd".split("123");

This gives an iterator, which you can loop over, or collect() into a vector.

for s in split {
  println!("{}", s)
}
let vec = split.collect::<Vec<&str>>();
// OR
let vec: Vec<&str> = split.collect();

You can also write it .collect::<Vec<_>>(). – Chris Morgan Oct 30 '14 at 2:19
   	 
	
how do I get the length of the result - let split? split.len() doesn't exist. – アレックス Oct 30 '14 at 14:00
   	 
	
@AlexanderSupertramp Use .count(). len() is only for iterators which know their exact size without needing to be consumed, count() consumes the iterator. – Manishearth Oct 30 '14 at 18:16

@AlexanderSupertramp let mut split, sorry. – Manishearth Dec 2 '14 at 7:49

There are three simple ways:

1) by separator:

s.split("separator")

2) by whitespaces:

s.split_whitespace()

3) by newlines:

s.lines()

Result is an options iterator:

let text = "foo\r\nbar\n\nbaz\n";
let mut lines = text.lines();

assert_eq!(Some("foo"), lines.next());
assert_eq!(Some("bar"), lines.next());
assert_eq!(Some(""), lines.next());
assert_eq!(Some("baz"), lines.next());

assert_eq!(None, lines.next());

There's also split_whitespace()

fn main() {
    let words: Vec<&str> = "   foo   bar\t\nbaz   ".split_whitespace().collect();
    println!("{:?}", words);
    // ["foo", "bar", "baz"] 
}

There is a special method split for struct String here: http://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.split

fn split<'a, P>(&'a self, pat: P) -> Split<'a, P> where P: Pattern<'a>

Split by char:

let v: Vec<&str> = "Mary had a little lamb".split(' ').collect();
assert_eq!(v, ["Mary", "had", "a", "little", "lamb"]);

Split by string:

let v: Vec<&str> = "lion::tiger::leopard".split("::").collect();
assert_eq!(v, ["lion", "tiger", "leopard"]);

Split by closure:

let v: Vec<&str> = "abc1def2ghi".split(|c: char| c.is_numeric()).collect();
assert_eq!(v, ["abc", "def", "ghi"]);
